# Expense-Tracker-using-React.js
A expenses/budgeting app made using React &amp; React Router DOM. It uses local storage to save a user's data in the browser. I will be adding database feature to this in future.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
